# Twitter Weather Bot

As I was following along with the Python Tweepy tutorial found on the [project-based-learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning) repo, the original tutorial had been written a few years ago, making the tutorial outdated, so I am pivoting and trying to make a Twitter bot that posts daily weather tweets as a way to get familiar with API's and learn!
